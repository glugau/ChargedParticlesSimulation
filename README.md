# Charged particles simulation

This is a very simple charged particle simulation made using C++, OpenGL and GLFW.

To use this, simply launch the executable, and you will be able to interact with the simulation. At the top left of the window is a placeholder particle. The size indicates the mass, and the color indicates the charge (blue = negative, red = positive). To change these values, use your arrow keys: up and down control the mass, whereas left and right control the charge. To spawn a particle, you must click and drag your mouse. The further you drag, the more velocity the particle will have at spawn.

This idea is "inspired" (stolen) form this glorious YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06pH9i9yARQ

I also strongly recommend watching The Cherno's OpenGL tutorial series. I made this program to exercise a bit before advancing further into the series.
